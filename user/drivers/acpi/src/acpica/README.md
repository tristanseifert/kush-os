This directory contains the sources to [ACPICA](https://www.acpica.org), the reference implementation of ACPI. We need to add a few custom header files (to define our platform) so we simply copy the entire source tree here.

In the future, it should be replaced with a git submodule or something of that sort. The current version of ACPICA is `20210105`.
