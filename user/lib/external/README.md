# Third Party Libraries
This directory contains various third-party libraries that make up the userspace component of the OS. These are automatically built by the CMake file.

- [OpenLibm](https://github.com/JuliaMath/openlibm): Math library, to serve as an equivalent to libm.
- [mpack](https://github.com/ludocode/mpack): Fast C MessagePack implementation. Used extensively for RPC.
